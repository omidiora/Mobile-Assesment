# Mobile-Assesment
This is my result to the Prunedge First Phase Assessment:

I design the  screen using react-native . i created a resuable component for the Textinput also i used the react-native-responsive-screen  to ensure responsiveness . I also ensure i use the react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view to prevent screen overlapping
